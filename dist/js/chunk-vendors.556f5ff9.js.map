You can add animations for multiple attributes at the same time by using an animation definition object. This object should contain SMIL animation attributes. Please refer to http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/animate.html for a detailed specification about the available animation attributes. Additionally an easing property can be passed in the animation definition object. This can be a string with a name of an easing function in `Chartist.Svg.Easing` or an array with four numbers specifying a cubic Bézier curve.\n   * **An animations object could look like this:**\n   * ```javascript\n   * element.animate({\n   *   opacity: {\n   *     dur: 1000,\n   *     from: 0,\n   *     to: 1\n   *   },\n   *   x1: {\n   *     dur: '1000ms',\n   *     from: 100,\n   *     to: 200,\n   *     easing: 'easeOutQuart'\n   *   },\n   *   y1: {\n   *     dur: '2s',\n   *     from: 0,\n   *     to: 100\n   *   }\n   * });\n   * ```\n   * **Automatic unit conversion**\n   * For the `dur` and the `begin` animate attribute you can also omit a unit by passing a number. The number will automatically be converted to milli seconds.\n   * **Guided mode**\n   * The default behavior of SMIL animations with offset using the `begin` attribute is that the attribute will keep it's original value until the animation starts. Mostly this behavior is not desired as you'd like to have your element attributes already initialized with the animation `from` value even before the animation starts. Also if you don't specify `fill=\"freeze\"` on an animate element or if you delete the animation after it's done (which is done in guided mode) the attribute will switch back to the initial value. This behavior is also not desired when performing simple one-time animations. For one-time animations you'd want to trigger animations immediately instead of relative to the document begin time. That's why in guided mode Chartist.Svg will also use the `begin` property to schedule a timeout and manually start the animation after the timeout. If you're using multiple SMIL definition objects for an attribute (in an array), guided mode will be disabled for this attribute, even if you explicitly enabled it.\n   * If guided mode is enabled the following behavior is added:\n   * - Before the animation starts (even when delayed with `begin`) the animated attribute will be set already to the `from` value of the animation\n   * - `begin` is explicitly set to `indefinite` so it can be started manually without relying on document begin time (creation)\n   * - The animate element will be forced to use `fill=\"freeze\"`\n   * - The animation will be triggered with `beginElement()` in a timeout where `begin` of the definition object is interpreted in milli seconds. If no `begin` was specified the timeout is triggered immediately.\n   * - After the animation the element attribute value will be set to the `to` value of the animation\n   * - The animate element is deleted from the DOM\n   *\n   * @memberof Chartist.Svg\n   * @param {Object} animations An animations object where the property keys are the attributes you'd like to animate. The properties should be objects again that contain the SMIL animation attributes (usually begin, dur, from, and to). The property begin and dur is auto converted (see Automatic unit conversion). You can also schedule multiple animations for the same attribute by passing an Array of SMIL definition objects. Attributes that contain an array of SMIL definition objects will not be executed in guided mode.\n   * @param {Boolean} guided Specify if guided mode should be activated for this animation (see Guided mode).
